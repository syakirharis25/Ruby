## 1. Introduction.
<img src="ruby.png" height="150"> 
Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, Basic, and Lisp.
<br /><br />
Matsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simple Lisp language at its core, with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl. The syntax of Ruby is broadly similar to that of Perl and Python. Class and method definitions are signaled by keywords, whereas code blocks can be both defined by keywords or braces. In contrast to Perl, variables are not obligatorily prefixed with a sigil. When used, the sigil changes the semantics of scope of the variable. For practical purposes there is no distinction between expressions and statements. Line breaks are significant and taken as the end of a statement; a semicolon may be equivalently used. Unlike Python, indentation is not significant.

## 3. Ruby File.open modes.
 
| Mode |  Meaning                                                  
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
| "r"  |  Read-only, starts at beginning of file  (default mode).   
| "r+" |  Read-write, starts at beginning of file.                 
| "w"  |  Write-only, truncates existing file to zero length or creates a new file for writing.         
| "w+" |  Read-write, truncates existing file to zero length or creates a new file for reading and writing.             
| "a"  |  Write-only, starts at end of file if file exists, otherwise creates a new file for writing.                  
| "a+" |  Read-write, starts at end of file if file exists, otherwise creates a new file for reading and writing.
| "b"  |  Binary file mode (may appear with any of the key letters listed above). Suppresses EOL <-> CRLF conversion on Windows, and               sets external encoding to ASCII-8BIT unless explicitly specified.                                                 
| "t"  |  Text file mode (may appear with any of the key letters listed above except "b").
